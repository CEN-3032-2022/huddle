# Huddle (Twitter Clone)

Huddle is a social media platform where users can post messages with a 450 character limit. Users can interact publicly with the messages of other users (these messages are referred to as “honks”), or they can privately message another user via direct messaging.

To run the program, start the server class in the server package, and then start the app class in the client package. 

In the first release of the software, we have implemented the following features:
1. Users can create an account
2. Users can sign into their account with a username and password
3. Users can write and post a honk for others view
4. Users can view the honks of other users
5. Users can view the master wall of all the posted honks
6. Users can like or "heart" other honks
7. Users can view other profiles
8. Users can search for Huddle users with usernames
9. Users can search and view honks with hashtags
10. Users can follow other users
11. Users can view a customized wall of honks
12. Users can customize their profile
13. Users can search for other users with usernames
14. Users can tag and mention other users in honks
15. Users can view honks that they were mentioned/tagged in
